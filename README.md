# Sentimental-Analysis-through-Word-Cloud
In this project, I have developed an application that can do the sentiment analysis of youtube video comments section and display it in the form of word cloud,so that the creator of the video can have clear idea regarding the quality of content he/she delivers through his/her channel. This can be also used in various other fields like, social media, retail, corporate etc,.
In this project, I have included the following dependencies:- matplotlib- for plotting the cloud
                                                              wordcloud - for developing words
                                                              request - requests the youtube api key
                                                              nltk.sentiment.vader  - for doing sentiment analysis.
 before importing the last module, you need to install vader lexicon file.
